				From the moment I could hold a crayon, art has been my steadfast companion. What started as a
				childhood fascination quickly
				blossomed into an enduring love affair, a constant urge to create and explore. Even then, I knew my
				path was intertwined with
				the vibrant world of colors and forms.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-30">
				Art became more than just a passion during a challenging period in my life; it was a beacon, guiding
				me through darkness and
				helping me find my voice. Now, it brings me immeasurable joy, a feeling I pour into every
				brushstroke. As a self-taught artist with
				a background in interior design, I've honed my creative instincts, channeling them into bold,
				statement-making artworks that
				speak directly from the heart.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-30">
				My studio is a playground where I push boundaries and embrace the unexpected. I constantly challenge
				myself to try new things,
				finding beauty in the process of learning and celebrating every "happy mistake" that leads to an
				exciting discovery. You'll find
				my work a vibrant testament to this journey, as I explore the boundless possibilities of acrylic
				paints, inks, pastels, spray paint,
				and pencil on canvas. Each piece is a unique expression, capturing an essence of emotion and energy.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-30">
				What truly excites me about art is its power to transcend boundaries, inviting you to see and feel
				something uniquely personal.
				My pieces are deeply influenced by the lush intricacies of nature, the mysteries of the cosmos, and
				the depths of my own dream
				states and emotions. Here, you'll discover a collection that's as dynamic as it is evocativeâ€”an
				invitation to pause, reflect, and
				connect with the very essence of your own feelings.
			</p>

			<p class="">
				I invite you to explore my world and find a piece that resonates with your own story
